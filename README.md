I am a Cybersecurity SOC Analyst with CompTIA Security+ certification and 3 years of experience. Trained in conducting security assessments, compliance management, risk analysis, vulnerability testing, and incident triage and remediation. Comprehensive knowledge of cybersecurity foundations, frameworks, technologies, and techniques. Complex problem solving skills from 7 years in data analytics.

## Objective

My career started in investment analytics, but I found a passion for cybersecurity during the pandemic, which led me to transition into this field. I am eager to join a cybersecurity team, specifically a Security Operations Center (SOC), and eventually become a Chief Information Officer after gaining more experience and certifications.
